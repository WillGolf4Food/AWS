--Create a key pair for the ansible user on the control host, accepting the defaults when prompted:
su - ansible
ssh-keygen

--Copy the public key to both node1 and node2:
ssh-copy-id node1
ssh-copy-id node2

--Copy the public key to both node1 and node2:
ssh-copy-id node1
ssh-copy-id node2

--create a simple Ansible inventory on the control node in /home/ansible/inventory containing node1 and node2.
--On the control host:
su - ansible
touch /home/ansible/inventory
echo "node1" >> /home/ansible/inventory
echo "node2" >> /home/ansible/inventory

--configure sudo access for Ansible on node1 and node2 such that Ansible may use sudo for any command with no password prompt.
--Log in to node1 as cloud_user and edit the sudoers file to contain appropriate access for the ansible user:
ssh cloud_user@node1
sudo visudo

--Add the following line to the file and save:
ansible    ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
Enter:

logout
--Repeat these steps for node2, and then back out to the control node.

--To verify each node, run the following as the ansible user from the control host:
ansible -i /home/ansible/inventory node1 -m ping
ansible -i /home/ansible/inventory node2 -m ping

--To redirect output of a successful command to /home/ansible/output:
ansible -i /home/ansible/inventory node1 -m ping > /home/ansible/output
